# EnemyCounter

![EC-example](https://github.com/fpbellow/EnemyCounter/assets/47138704/201d8273-489b-4a08-ad77-bad1cc6e3c51)

Provides an option to retrieve the amount of combatants engaged with the player in brief messages.

Such include:
- No current combatants.
- Few foes remain.
- Multiple enemies present.
- Numerous enemies in the vicinity.


## Why did I make this?

In a recent playthrough, I had been using the [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/55456) preset for [FalloutUI - HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51813). 
With this preset, enemy markers no longer appear on the compass and rather than re-enabling such I found this method to provide a way to retrieve estimates of combatants without being provided the specific amount or location.
